# Literate programming exercises 
> Literate programming using R Markdown/Notebook, Jupyter Notebook, and Quarto

This repository contains three exercise files for practicing data analysis and visualization:

1. `R_notebook_bios259.Rmd`: R Notebook Markdown file.
2. `Quarto_excercise_bios259.qmd`: Quarto document.
3. `Jupyter-notebook-bios259.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook.

Follow the instructions below to run each exercise:

## R Notebook Exercise

1. Open RStudio.
2. Open the `R_notebook_bios259.Rmd` file.
3. Install any required R packages mentioned in the document using `install.packages(c('cowplot','ggplot2')`.
4. Preview the R Notebook document to produce the HTML report.

## Quarto Exercise

1. Install Quarto if you haven't already (`install.packages("quarto")`).
2. Open the `Quarto_excercise_bios259.qmd` file in RStudio or a text editor.
3. Run the Quarto document to produce the output.

## Jupyter Notebook Exercise

1. If you've already installed Jupyter Notebook and `seaborn` python package. If you haven't already installed, use the `environment.yaml` provided in the repo.
2. Navigate to the directory containing `Jupyter-notebook-bios259.ipynb` in your terminal.
3. Run `jupyter notebook` to start the Jupyter Notebook server.
4. Open `Jupyter-notebook-bios259.ipynb` in the Jupyter interface and execute the code cells.

Feel free to explore and modify the exercises to practice your data analysis skills!
